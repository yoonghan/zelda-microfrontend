# Microservice frontend ver. 2, via single spa framework

Differentiate from [module federation](https://github.com/yoonghan/walcron-microfrontend), this prototype is to use Single Spa.
Documentation is abit of difficult to go thru (seems leaning more on courses), but the usage is much more linear and straigh-forward, the rules still applies similar to module federation where each apps are loaded(but compulsary to be lazy) from a main/root/shell application.
